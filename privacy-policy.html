            <h2>1. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
            <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store any personal data on remote servers. All information, such as recipes, preferences, and any notes you make within the app, is securely stored locally on your device. This means that we have no access to this data, and it is never shared with third parties.</p>

            <h2>2. User Information and Personal Data</h2>
            <p>Our app does not collect, request, or process any personal data from you. You can enjoy our services with peace of mind, knowing your personal information remains private.</p>

            <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
            <p>To enable certain features, such as saving or organizing recipes, the app may request specific permissions, such as access to storage on your device. Rest assured, this is solely to enhance your experience within the app, and we do not access or store this information elsewhere.</p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Since we don’t collect or share data, no third-party services (like analytics or advertising networks) are integrated into our app. This ensures that your information is private and secure.</p>

            <h2>5. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
